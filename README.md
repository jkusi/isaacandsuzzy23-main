# DevOps for Wedding Site

## Objective

My objective is to apply DevOps principles and practices to set up a robust and automated deployment pipeline for my brother's wedding website. By implementing effective CI/CD processes and infrastructure automation, I aim to ensure a seamless and reliable online experience for the wedding guests.

## Key Tasks

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Utilize tools like Terraform to define and provision the required cloud resources for hosting the wedding website.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Implement a CI pipeline using Jenkins, GitHub CI/CD

- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Set up a CD pipeline to automatically deploy changes to a staging environment after successful testing, and then promote the changes to production.

- **Containerization**: Containerize the application using Docker to ensure consistency across different environments and simplify deployment.

- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement monitoring and alerting solutions such as Prometheus and Grafana to keep track of the website's performance and availability.

- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity and availability in case of failures.

## Technologies and Tools

- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform and Ansible 
- Continuous Integration: Jenkins
- Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes 
- Monitoring and Logging: Grafana and ELK Stack
- Cloud Platform: Proxmox
- Version Control: Git
